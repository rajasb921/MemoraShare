<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
MemoraShare is meant to be a concept idea for a social media web application designed exclusively for teenagers and college students. The web app centers around creating and sharing memories through a visually appealing timeline that displays photos of important events. Users can collaborate with friends on shared events, fostering a sense of collectiveness. MemoraShare offers a perfect blend of privacy and sociability, allowing users to mark certain events as private while showcasing others publicly on their profiles.
